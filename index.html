<h2>About Me</h2>

  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>My name is Charita Dudrick, and I am currently a student at Delaware County Community College pursuing a Web Development Certificate. 
 My goal is to continue learning and growing my skills so I can become a full‑stack developer. I have a passion for both front‑end design and the back‑end 
logic that powers modern applications, and I believe this career path is a natural fit for my curiosity, creativity, and love of problem‑solving.</p>
<p>I am a goal‑oriented, self‑motivated individual with strong time‑management skills and a solid work ethic. Throughout my career, I have managed teams, 
trained new employees, served as a team lead, and worked as a general manager. These roles strengthened my leadership, communication, and organizational abilities. 
What I enjoy most, however, is solving puzzles, learning new things, and overcoming challenges. I am a quick learner who adapts well to new environments and thrives 
when exploring unfamiliar territory.</p>
 <p>Outside of web development, I am an abstract painter, singer, and designer. I am also the owner of <strong>Spoken In Silences</strong>, 
a small business that offers handcrafted art and emotionally expressive designs. My creative work influences the way I approach technology — with intention, 
emotion, and a desire to build meaningful experiences. I bring both artistic sensitivity and technical curiosity to everything I create, and I am excited to continue 
growing in a field that blends creativity and logic so naturally.</p>
